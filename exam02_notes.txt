Q5:
The issue with the stacked bar is that you are not utilizing the y-axis (height) and that is unexpected for readers. The main goal should be to see the distribution of the answers and not necessarily that they add up to 100% (which is secondary)


Q6:

First chart is more informative since it captures more data: (a) republican margin in 2020, (b) republican margin in 2024, and (c) the change between both elections


Q10:

The bar chart should not be used for averages per our discussion in class. Moreover, it does not capture the distribution; you should use a box plot or a histogram.
