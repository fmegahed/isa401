Kanye:
------------
The arcs/areas are not proportional to the data


CNN Chart:
------------
Not a major issue -- refer to our in-class discussion this coming Monday but given the wording of the question, your answer is acceptable

-----------
The regression line does not follow the data at all -- see our discussion of dataset 4 for enscombe's data


Where Americans are born:

Area is not used as an encoding mechanism since all areas are equal. In a cartogram, area is used to encode one variable of interest (e.g., see our discussion of the cartogram of U.S. House Elections)


Question 21: 
------------
- -1 for using a vertical bar chart where the state names are more difficult to read when compared to a horizontal bar chart

- -4 for submitting a twb instead of a packaged tableau workbook

- -7 for a fatal analysis mistake  (you should have taken the max of both cases and deaths); your current analysis indicates that there were:
 13.67M covid cases in Butler County (population size of around 400,000) and that half the residents of the state of Ohio have died from COVID

    - 3 if the student tried to mitigate it by counting or averaging or some other measure that results in incorrect numbers
