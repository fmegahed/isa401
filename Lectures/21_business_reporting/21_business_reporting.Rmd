# Dashboards vs Scorecards

.pull-left[
.content-box-grey[
.center[.font120[**Dashboards**]]

- Dashboards provide **monitoring tools for operational performance (often in real-time)**.  
- Dashboards monitor performance by **tracking metrics (typically over-time and often without comparing them to target values).**

]
]

.pull-right[
.content-box-grey[
.center[.font120[**Scorecards**]]

- Scorecards provide a **snapshot of current performance (as measured using KPIs) vs. their targets**.  
- Current performance is **an aggregated measure** (e.g., day/month), i.e., ~ static
- **Goal:** make better strategic decisions based on the $distance = target - performance$

# Automating Business Reports

# Automating Visual Business Reports

In many data visualization software, this can be accomplished easily by: 

- Live connections to data files and databases; or  

- Auto-refreshing or some similar concept.

Hence, we often think of **BI dashboards as tools for real-time performance monitoring**.
