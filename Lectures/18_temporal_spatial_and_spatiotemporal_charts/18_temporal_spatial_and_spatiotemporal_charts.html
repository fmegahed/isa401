# Time Series Data

**Time Series Data:** Comparable measurements recorded on a single (or a few) variables over time (usually a long period of time).

**Example 2:** Stock prices of U.S. Airlines

# Components of a Time Series

---

# Trend 

A **trend** is an increasing or decreasing pattern over time.

# Seasonality

**Seasonality** refers to the property of a time series that displays REGULAR patterns that repeat at a constant frequency (*m*).

&lt;img src="18_temporal_spatial_and_spatiotemporal_charts_files/figure-html/airpassengers-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

# Cycle 

**Cyclical fluctuations** are somewhat irregular (unknown duration).

# The Goals Behind Visualizing (Time Series) Data

---

# Exploratory vs Confirmatory Viz Goals

&gt; _Visualizations can be used to explore data, to confirm a hypothesis, or to manipulate
a viewer. . . In exploratory visualization the user does not necessarily
know what he is looking for. This creates a dynamic scenario in which interaction
is critical. . . In a confirmatory visualization, the user has a
hypothesis that needs to be tested. This scenario is more stable and predictable.
System parameters are often predetermined._ -- [(Grinstein and Ward 2001, 22)](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Information_Visualization_in_Data_Mining/rYFvnyPRwkgC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=Grinstein%2C%20Georges%20G%2C%20and%20Matthew%20O%20Ward.%202001.%20%E2%80%9CIntroduction%20to%20Data%20Visualization.%E2%80%9D%20In%20Information%20Visualization%20in%20Data%20Mining%20and%20Knowledge%20Discovery%2C%20edited%20by%20Usama%20Fayyad%2C%20Georges%20G%20Grinstein%2C%20and%20Andreas%20Wierse%2C%2021%E2%80%9345.%20San%20Francisco%2C%20CA%3A%20Morg&amp;pg=PA22&amp;printsec=frontcover)

# Recap

# Summary of Main Points

- Understand main goals behind visualizing time-series data  

- Explain the different types of charts for univariate and multivariate time-series  

- Explain the different types of spatial plots  

- Select suitable spatial graphs for different scenarios  

- Understand how spatiotemporal plots can help in storytelling (what makes BI special)
