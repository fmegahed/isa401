# Error Correction <br>(i.e., Correcting Inconsistencies in the Data)


---

# Correction

> Correction methods aim to fix inconsistent observations by **altering invalid values in a record based on information from valid values**. Depending on the method this is either a **single-step procedure** or a **two-step procedure** where first, an error localization method is used to empty certain fields, followed by an imputation step. --- [De Jonge and Van Der Loo (2013)](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/de_Jonge+van_der_Loo-Introduction_to_data_cleaning_with_R.pdf)

# Simple Transformation Rules

In practice, data cleaning procedures involve a lot of **ad-hoc transformations**. This may lead to long scripts where one selects parts of the data, changes some variables, selects another part, changes some more variables, etc. 

- When such scripts are neatly written and commented, they can almost be **treated as a log of the actions** performed by the analyst. 

- However, as scripts get longer it is **better to store the transformation rules separately and log which rule is executed on what record**.

One approach to **do** this in R is through the [deducorrect package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/deducorrect/deducorrect.pdf).

```{r functions_determinstic_correction, echo=FALSE}
library(gt)
tidyr <- tribble(
  ~ type, ~ `package_name`, ~ `fun()`, ~ `description`, 
  "**rules**", "deducorrect", "correctionRules()", "Rules for determinstic correction",
  "**correction**", "deducorrect", "correctWithRules()", "Apply simple replacement rules to a data.frame."
  
)

tidyr |> 
  gt() |> 
  fmt_markdown(everything()) |> 
  cols_label(
    `type` = md("`type`"),
    `package_name` = md("`package`"),
    `fun()` = md("`function()`"),
    `description` = md("`description`"),
  ) |> 
  as_raw_html()

```


---

# Simple Transformation Rules: Example

.pull-left[
```{r rules_det_correction}
people = tibble::tibble(
  name = c('Tom Cruise', 'Serena Williams', 'Taylor Swift', 'Ariana Grande', 'The Rock'),
  height = c(172, 1.75, 69.3, 154, 6.25),
  unit = c('cm', 'm', 'inch', 'cm', 'ft')
)

u <- deducorrect::correctionRules(
  expression(
    ## 1-------
    if(unit == "cm") height <- height/100,
    ## 2-------
    if(unit == "inch") height <- height/39.37,
    ## 3-------
    if(unit == "ft") height <- height/3.28,
    ## 4-------
    unit <- "m"
  ))


```
Note that the rules **can also be stored in a txt file**.

```{r rules_det_correction2}
people_corrected = deducorrect::correctWithRules( #<<
  rules = u, dat = people) #<<

# Deductive Correction

When the data you are analyzing is generated by people rather than machines or measurement devices, certain typical human-generated errors are likely to occur. Examples include: (a) **typing errors** in numbers, (b) **rounding errors** in numbers, and (c) **sign errors**.

These errors can be accounted for through the [deducorrect package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/deducorrect/deducorrect.pdf).

```{r functions_dedu_correction, echo=FALSE}
library(gt)
tidyr <- tribble(
  ~ type, ~ `package_name`, ~ `fun()`, ~ `description`, 
  "**rule def**", "editrules", "editmatrix()", "A set of comparison operators representing a linear system of (in)equations. The function editmatrix generates an editmatrix from a character vector, or an expression vector.",
  "**typos**", "deducorrect", "correctTypos()", "Tries to detect and repair records that violate linear equality constraints by correcting simple typos",
  "**rounding**", "deducorrect", "correctRounding()", "Tries to detect and repair records that violate linear (in)equality constraints by correcting possible rounding errors",
  "**sign**", "deducorrect", "correctSigns()", "Correct sign errors and value interchanges in data records."
  
)

tidyr |> 
  gt() |> 
  fmt_markdown(everything()) |> 
  cols_label(
    `type` = md("`type`"),
    `package_name` = md("`package`"),
    `fun()` = md("`function()`"),
    `description` = md("`description`"),
  ) |>

# Deductive Correction: Correct Typos

```{r typos}
e <- editrules::editmatrix("x + y == z") # defining the rules
d <- data.frame(x = 123, y = 132, z = 246) # creating the data frame
cor <- deducorrect::correctTypos(e, d) # attempting to correct Typos #<<

# Types of Missing Data: MCAR

Missing data are typically grouped into three categories:  

- **Missing completely at random (MCAR):** When data are MCAR, the fact that the data are missing is independent of the observed and unobserved data. For example,  
  * If we were to perform annual health checks for all FSB students, some of you may have missing lab values because a batch of lab samples was processed improperly.  
  * Here, the missing data **reduce the analyzable population of the study and consequently, the statistical power, but do not introduce bias:** when data are MCAR, the **remaining data can be considered a simple random sample of the full data set** of interest. 
  * Hence, the `NA` data can be simply be handled by removing such observations. In R, the `na.omit()` can be used without the need for introducing any packages. We refer to this `NA` handling approach as **complete case analysis**.

# Types of Missing Data: MAR

- **Missing at random (MAR):** When data are MAR, the fact that the **data are missing is systematically related to the observed but not the unobserved data**. For example,   
  * A dataset examining depression may encounter data that are MAR if male participants are less likely to complete a survey about depression severity than female participants.   
  * That is, if the probability of survey completion is related to their `sex` (which is fully observed) but **not the severity of their depression**, then the data may be regarded as MAR. 
  * Approaches to Handle `NAs` for MAR Data:    
      + Complete case analyses of MAR data may or may not result in bias.  
      + Impute (i.e., guess) the missing values based on a proper accounting of the known factors (e.g., their sex)

# Types of Missing Data: MNAR

- **Missing not at random (MNAR):** When data are MNAR, the fact that the data are missing is **systematically related to the unobserved data**, that is, the missingness is related to events or factors which are not measured by the researcher. To extend the previous example,   
  * the depression registry may encounter data that are MNAR if participants with severe depression are more likely to refuse to complete the survey about depression severity.  
  * Approaches to Handle `NAs` for MAR Data:    
      + Complete case analyses of MAR data may or may not result in bias.  
      + Imputation approaches **may not be suitable since the missigness pattern is due to the impact of unobserved auxiliary variables**.
