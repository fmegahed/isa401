# Graphical Excellence: What should Graphs Do?

 - **Show the data**  
 
 - Lead to thinking about the **substance**  rather than something else  
 
 - Avoid **distorting** what the data have to say  
 
 - Present **many numbers in a small space**  
 
 - Make **large datasets coherent**  
 
 - Encourage the eye to **compare different pieces of the data**  
 
 - **Reveal the data at several levels of detail**, from a broad overview to the
fine structure  

 - Serve **a purpose:** description, exploration, tabulation, decoration  
 
 - Be **closely integrated with the statistical & verbal descriptions of the data**

# Show/Reveal the Data: Anscombe's Dataset

**In a seminal paper, Anscombe stated:** 

> **Few of us escape being indoctrinated with these notions:** 
>  - numerical **calculations are exact, but graphs are rough**; 
>  - for any particular kind of **statistical data there is just one set of calculations constituting a correct statistical analysis**;  
>  - performing **intricate calculations is virtuous**, whereas **actually looking at the data is cheating**.

He proceeded by stating that 
> a computer should **make both calculations and graphs**. Both sorts of output should be studied; each will contribute to understanding.

Now, let us consider his four datasets, each consisting of eleven (x,y) pairs.

 - Clear, detailed, and thorough labeling and appropriate scales

 - Size of the graphic effect should be directly proportional to the numerical quantities (“lie factor”)  
 
 - Show data variation, not design variation

# Definition of Data Ink

- **Data-ink refers to the non-erasable ink used for presenting the data**.  
  
  * If data-ink would be removed from the image, the graphic would lose the content.
  

$$
\begin{split}
\text{Data-ink ratio} &= \frac{\text{Data-ink}}{\text{Total ink used to print the graphic}} \\
\\
&= \text{proportion of a graphic's ink devoted to the} \\

# Color Blindness

> "About 1 in 12 men are color blind" -- [NIH's At a glance: Color Blindness](At a glance: Color Blindness)

### Color Blindness Can Distort a Person's Reading/Interpretation of a Chart

- **Personal Check:** [To have a feel for color blindness (if you are not color blind), you can take this color blind test](https://enchroma.com/pages/test)  

- Given the high prevalence of color blind individuals, your charts **should** accommodate for color-blindness. **How?**  

  * Use color sparingly
  * Use color friendly palettes, e.g., see <https://colorbrewer2.org/>

# Summary of Main Points

By now, you should be able to do the following:  

- Explain the concept of "graphical excellence"  

- Explain the theory of data graphics  

- Optimize visual encoding based on data types  

- Understand why color should be used sparingly and how to select appropriate colors (when color is a must)

# Things to Do Prior to Next Class

Please go through the following two supplementary readings and complete [assignment 08](https://miamioh.instructure.com/courses/223961/quizzes/667848).  

1. [The Lie Factor and the Baseline Paradox](https://nightingaledvs.com/the-lie-factor-and-the-baseline-paradox/); especially noting what the authors mean by "baseline", how the lie factor may be ignored in time-series applications, and/or in applications involving a "ratio" scale.  

2. [Useful junk? The effects of visual embellishment on comprehension and memorability of charts](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1753326.1753716?casa_token=GiPCX3MfWRAAAAAA:bj4hH3e73nNkD5ldnL_ohbDqkA_dBhAdTR9HE3A215Mks4E6Lja3lJL90rIqlLXWu1puahbk5XZq), which presents an experimental counter against Tufte's argument for simplicity (by quantifying vividness and recall of data from the more artistic charts). Note they define **"ratio"** different from how we have defined in class.
