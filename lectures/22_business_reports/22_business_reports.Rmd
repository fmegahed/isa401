# Dashboards vs Scorecards

.pull-left[
.content-box-grey[
.center[.font120[**Dashboards**]]

- Dashboards provide **monitoring tools for operational performance (often in real-time)**.  
- Dashboards monitor performance by **tracking metrics (typically over-time and often without comparing them to target values).**

]
]

.pull-right[
.content-box-grey[
.center[.font120[**Scorecards**]]

- Scorecards provide a **snapshot of current performance (as measured using KPIs) vs. their targets**.  
- Current performance is **an aggregated measure** (e.g., day/month), i.e., ~ static
- **Goal:** make better strategic decisions based on the $distance = target - performance$

# 0.15pt Bonus Activity: Paper Airplanes

`r countdown(minutes = 15, seconds = 0, top = 0, font_size = "2em")`


.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Activity Description]

> Over the next 15 minutes, please design the **best paper plane that
can consistently hit the target on the whiteboard (from a distance of 6ft)**.

**Games Rules:**

- You are allowed to use any of the material that was brought to class.  
- Work with your group to have the best design.  
- You can look up designs online or design your own -- no design restrictions.  
- When testing, make sure that there no people between your launching point and your target.   
- A demo will proceed for the teams that want to “show-off” their talents.
- **Winning team gets 0.15 point (out of 25) added to their Exam II Grade.**

# Automating Business Reports

---

# Automating Visual Business Reports

In many data visualization software, this can be accomplished easily by: 

- Live connections to data files and databases; or  

- Auto-refreshing or some similar concept.

Hence, we often think of **BI dashboards as tools for real-time performance monitoring**.
