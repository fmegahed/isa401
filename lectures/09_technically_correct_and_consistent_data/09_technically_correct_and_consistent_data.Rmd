# Data Analysis: A Crowd-Sourced Definition

Wikipedia's [data analysis article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis) defines it to be the **process** of:

> inspecting, cleansing, transforming and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusion and supporting decision-making. Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of names, and is used in different business, science, and social science domains.

# Technically Correct Data

> Raw data files may lack headers, contain wrong data types (e.g. numbers stored as strings), wrong category labels, unknown or unexpected character encoding and so on.

> **Technically correct data** is the state in which data can be read into an R data.frame, with correct **name**, **types** and **labels**, without further trouble. However, that **does not mean that the values are error-free or complete**. --- [De Jonge and Van Der Loo (2013)](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/de_Jonge+van_der_Loo-Introduction_to_data_cleaning_with_R.pdf)

# `r fontawesome::fa('r-project')` Functions for Changing Column Classes

- **Convert to Factor:** 
  * To convert a numeric vector to factors, we will typically use the chain of `as_factor( as_character() )`.  
  * To convert a character vector to factors, we will simply use the `as_factor()`.
  
- **Convert to Date:**
  * To convert a character vector to date, you should use an appropriate function or chain of functions from the `lubridate` `r fontawesome::fa("box", fill = 'gold')`.

- To change multiple columns at once, we will resort to the `mutate_at()` or `mutate_if` functions from the `dplyr` `r fontawesome::fa("box", fill = 'gold')`.

- **For any of the above operations, we will need to overwrite the original column's data.**

"forcats", "df$fct_column = fct_recode(df$fct_column, fruit = 'apple')", "If the factor colum contained a level called apple, it will be renamed to fruit. Multiple levels can be changed per `?fct_recode`"

# Towards Consistent Data

---

# Consistent Data

> **Consistent data** is the stage where data is ready for statistical inference. It is the data that most statistical theories use as a starting point. Ideally, such theories can still be applied without taking previous data cleaning steps into account. In practice however, data cleaning methods like imputation of missing values will influence statistical results and so must be accounted for in the following analyses or interpretation thereof. --- [De Jonge and Van Der Loo (2013)](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/de_Jonge+van_der_Loo-Introduction_to_data_cleaning_with_R.pdf)

### Features of Consistent Data

- [Usually] no missing data

- Values within and across columns meet your expected "rules" for the data

- It is what we will colloquially refer to as "clean" data


---

# Considerations to Achieving Consistent Data

1. Do you have **missing values** in any of the variables?

2. Are the **values for each variable** reasonable? e.g., do you have a negative age?

3. Are the values **across the columns for a given observation reasonable**? e.g., does the count of registered and casual riders add up to the total number of riders?



### Some Useful Packages in `r fontawesome::fa('r-project')` 

- The [pointblank](https://rich-iannone.github.io/pointblank/) `r fontawesome::fa('box', fill = 'gold')` for data validation.  

- The [editrules](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/editrules/index.html) and [deducorrect](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/deducorrect/index.html) `r fontawesome::fa('box', fill = 'gold')` for localizing errors and performing some basic imputations of data.

- Note that any efforts to achieve consistent data **will have to be:**  
  * Dataset dependent; and
  * Research question dependent

# A Demo Using a Popular Bikesharing Dataset

---

# Tasks

In this in-class, demo we will:

- Read the [bike_sharing_data.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fmegahed/isa401/main/data/bike_sharing_data.csv) data. The description of all fields (with the exception of the `sources` column) can be found at [Kaggle dataset description](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/data).  

- Check whether the dataset is **technically correct**, **generate a report on how each variable meets/contradicts its expected data type/class**, and **fix any observed issue(s)**.

- We will create a set of **consistency rules** for variables and examine the instances (rows) when any of the rules are violated.

- We will generate an additional report on the status of our **data's consistency**.
