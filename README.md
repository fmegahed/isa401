# ISA 401: An Undergrad Course on Business Intelligence & Data Visualization
This repo contains my lecture notes (created in R Markdown) for an undergraduate business intelligence and data visualization course. The course is divided into three main phases:  
  - **Phase 1: Extracting, Transforming and Loading Data** -- I chose to utilize the R programming language as the software tool of choice for this phase. Other instructors at Miami use Power BI (a Microsoft software tool for this purpose).  
  - **Phase 2: Data Visualization**, which covers both basic principles behind data visualization and how to make charts. Many of our students are expected to learn Tableau for their jobs and hence, I mix Tableau and Power BI (to mantain consistency with other sections taught at my school) and introduce some neat charts from R along the way due to my belief that scripted languages provide a good understanding of the grammar of making good graphics.  
  - **Phase 3: A Very Short Introduction to Exploratory/Visual Data Mining Tools**.

## Acknowledgments
 * Phase I has benefited heavily from the following references:   
     + The excellent  [STATS 220 Data Technologies](https://stats220.earo.me/) course by @earowang.  
     + The manuscript [An Introduction to Data Cleaning with R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/de_Jonge+van_der_Loo-Introduction_to_data_cleaning_with_R.pdf).  
     + Hadley Wickham's excellent books ([R For Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/)).
* Phase III capitalizes on the third edition of [Mining of Massive Datasets](http://www.mmds.org/).  

## Notes
 * I did my best to add references whenver possible. If I missed a reference, please let me know (via a pull request, PR).
 * If you have identified mistakes/typos, please let me know. Teaching a course in the midst of a pandemic, with your university's decision to increase the number of course preps, is interesting (to say the least).
